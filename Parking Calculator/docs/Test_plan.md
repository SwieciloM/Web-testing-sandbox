<h1 align="center">PARKING CALCULATOR ‚Äì TEST PLAN</h1>

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the test plan for the [Parking Cost Calculator](https://www.shino.de/parkcalc/) web application, designed to calculate parking costs based on user input. The page also includes business requirements listed under the heading "Parking Rates", which serve as the test basis for designing test cases.

### 2. Goals
The main goal is to determine the quality of the application through tests that are designed to find as many defects as possible.

### 3. Test strategy
In order to meet the project objectives, the following tests will be conducted:
- Automated functional tests on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Manual functional tests necessary to obtain information for the bug reports

### 4. Scope
#### 4.1 In Scope
- Cost calculation logic including:
  - Different parking types (Valet, Short-Term, Economy)
  - Different date/time (with edge cases)
- Input validation
- Widgets interactivity (buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes, date picker)
- System behaviour on different browsers

#### 4.2 Out of Scope
- Non-functional features (e.g. performance)

### 5. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Test Lead/Tester**: Me (Micha≈Ç ≈öwiƒôci≈Ço)

### 6. Entry Criteria
- The app is deployed and accessible at [https://www.shino.de/parkcalc/](https://www.shino.de/parkcalc/)
- Python environment with Selenium is ready

### 7. Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases executed
- All bug reports created
- Final report created

### 8. Schedule
